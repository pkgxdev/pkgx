# Path.ts

Note not actually vendored yet as we haven’t yet published this package.

Goals:

1. Chainable
2. Robust
3. noop if the result of a requested operation has already been done.
4. Delightful
5. Conforms to principle of least surprise
6. Consistent

Based on [mxcl/Path.swift](https://github.com/mxcl/Path.swift)

# PathUtils.ts

Companion library to `Path.ts`. Contains common path-oriented
operations that don't specifically belong on a `Path` object.
