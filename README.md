Package managers prop up every developer’s stack.
With great power comes great responsibility—but like—packagers sit beneath all other developer tools;
couldn’t they do so much more?

We think so.

tea abstracts away packaging; its a *universal* virtual environment manager,
a *universal* interpreter; it’s a *universal* dependency manager.
tea makes packaging *programmable* by exposing it as a set of primitives that can be composed into entirely new tools.
Change how you work.
Change how your team works.
*Change how the world works*.

# tea/cli 0.3.1

tea is a universal virtual‑environment manager:

```sh
$ deno
zsh: command not found: deno

$ echo $PATH
/opt/homebrew/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin

$ cd my-project
$ deno
deno 1.22.1
> ^D

$ env
PATH=/opt/deno.land/v1.20.3/bin:/usr/bin:/bin
SRCROOT=/src/my-project
VERSION=…
…
```

You need 34 dependencies to compile our white-paper but with tea there’s
nothing to think about:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/teaxyz/white-paper
$ cd white-paper
$ make
tea: installing dependencies…
…
$ open tea.white-paper.pdf
```

tea is a universal interpreter:

```sh
$ tea https://github.com/teaxyz/demos/blob/main/demo.go input.txt
tea: installing go 1.18.3
go: running demo.go
…
```

We infer interpreter from the extension, shebang, YAML front matter or
open graph metadata (we’ve added packaging extensions).

tea is a universal dependency manager†:

```sh
$ tea https://github.com/teaxyz/demos/blob/main/ai-image-gen.py input.png
tea: installing python^3
pip: installing pytorch.org^1.11
…
ai-image-gen: optimizing output.png

$ curl https://github.com/teaxyz/demos/blob/main/ai.py
#!/usr/bin/env tea
# ---
# dependencies:
#   python.org: ~3.8
#   pypi.org/pytorch: ^1.11
#   optipng.sourceforge.net: '*'    # optipng will be in `PATH`
# ---
…
```

> † we use the term dependency manager for tools like npm, pip, cargo and gem

tea makes [Markdown] executable:

```sh
$ tea https://github.com/teaxyz/demos/favicon-cheat-sheet.md input.png
favicon: generating sizes
favicon: optimizing images with optipng
…
```

You can use this to make the instructions in your `README` executable,
for both users and automation:

```sh
$ tea ./README.md  # interprets `# Getting Started`
tea: npm install
tea: npm start

$ sh <(curl tea.xyz) https://github.com/my/project
tea: cloning…
tea: npm start

$ git clone https://github.com/my/project
$ cd project
$ tea build
tea: executing `# Build`
```

## A Brief Diatribe

Every programming language, every build system, every compiler, web server,
database and email client seem to gravitate towards adding infinite features
and complexity so that their users can do ever more and more.

This is contrary to the UNIX philosophy: tools should do one thing and
—by being tight and focused—
do it *damn* well.
If they are composable and flexible then they can be combined,
piped and leveraged into a larger,
more capable toolbox.
*The Internet is built with this toolbox.*

Nowadays every programming language
reimplements the same set of libraries and tools because using a
well-maintained, mature and portable library that lives higher up the stack
adds too much complexity.
This extends the adolescence of new languages,
results in no single language even becoming truly state of the art
and leads to degrees of
duplication that make the open source ecosystem *fragile*.
This is to the detriment of all software, everywhere.

tea is designed to remove this complexity for development, for deployment *and
for scripting*.

&nbsp;


# Getting Started

Installing tea is easy:

```sh
sh <(curl https://tea.xyz)
# • barely touches anything (/opt/tea.xyz, /usr/local/bin/tea)
# • makes you confirm you’re cool before it does that
```

In fact, the tea one-liner abstracts away installation:

```sh
$ sh <(curl https://tea.xyz) https://example.com/script.ts

# works the same as:
$ tea https://example.com/script.ts
```

Now in your blog posts, tweets and tutorials you don’t have to start
with any “how to install tea” preamble nor will they need to google anything.
If they want to learn about tea first they can go to the same URL as they’re
curl’ing. And as soon as we enable cross platform support this one-liner
will work for everyone, everywhere.

## Usage as an Environment Manager

You’re a developer, installing tools globally makes no sense. With tea the
tools you need per project or script are available to that workspace as
*virtual environments*. Our magic works from depths of libc to the heights of
the latests fads in CSS precompilers. All versions†. All platforms‡.

> † We’re new software, give us time to achieve this promise.\
> ‡ Windows, Raspberry Pi, BeOS, etc. coming soon!

When you `cd` into a project in your terminal, tea sets up the environment so
your tools “just work”. To do this it looks for a dependencies table in
your `README`.

For an example see our “[dependencies](#dependencies)” section
(teaception: we use tea to build tea).

You can check what environment this generates with `tea`:

```sh
tea --env --dump
```

`--env` specifies that tea will generate an environment based on the source
control checkout. So if you’re using git we’ll look around for a `.git`
directory and consider that the `SRCROOT` for your project. Then we check the
`README.md` there to gather the environment information.

tea attempts to further enhance your environment based on your workspace
context:

| Variable  | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| `VERSION` | Extracted from the `README` |
| `SRCROOT` | We descend towards root until we find a source control marker, eg. `.git` |
| `MANPATH` | So `man …` works for your deps |

We also provide eg. `PKG_CONFIG_PATH`, `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`, `DEVELOPER_DIR`,
etc. so other tools can find your dependencies. We provide other variables for
convenience too, like `GITHUB_SLUG` (extracted from your `git remote`) which
can be surprisingly useful to automation scripts.

~We also inject shell completions for your environment.~ *coming soon*

&nbsp;


## Usage as an Interpreter

You can use tea to execute pretty much any script from any location. We’ll
auto-magically install the right interpreter (as an isolated virtual
environment—there are no global consequences to your system).

```sh
$ tea my-script.py
```

tea sees the `.py` file extension, so it installs the latest version of Python
and then executes the script.

If you want more control over the python version then we need to edit the
script’s YAML front-matter, eg:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python

"""
---
dependencies:
  python.org: ^2.7
---
"""

# snip …
```

tea will run the script with the latest version of Python that is >=2.7 but
less than 3.0. If it's not installed we grab it, otherwise we use what is
available.


### Using a Shebang

You can `#!/usr/bin/env tea`, and you’d possibly choose this because tea can
do more than install dependencies. You may recall our earlier diatribe about
tools sticking to what they’re good at—*we really believe this*. Thus
having tools evolve to be configurable for project environments is something
we think should be left to *us*.

For example, `deno` is a wonderful interpreter for JavaScript and TypeScript,
but it has no project configuration capabilities which means if you want to
use it for scripts you may have to mess around a little. We think deno should
stay this way, and instead we can use tea:

```ts
#!/usr/bin/env tea

/* ---
tea:
  env: true   # †
dependencies:
  deno.land: ^1.18
args:
  - deno
  - run
  - --allow-net
  - --import-map={{ srcroot }}/import-map.json
--- */

// snip …
```

Which would go like this:

```sh
$ pwd
/src
$ tea ./script.ts my-arg
tea: /opt/deno.land/v1.18/bin/deno run \
  --allow-net \
  --import-map=/src/import-map.json \
  /src/script.ts \
  my-arg
```

> † specifying `env: true` is necessary to use `{{ srcroot }}` later in the
> YAML. You would also use it for any
> project that has an environment your scripts might need. Probably your
> project already specifies your `deno` dependency, so the above YAML is
> possibly being redundant.

&nbsp;


## Caveats

tea is **new software** and not mature. If you are an enterprise, we don’t
recommend using tea *yet*. If you are devshop or open source developer then
welcome! Dig in 🤝.

We only support macOS currently, though the Linux binary works pretty well.
Also, currently we require zsh.

We intend to be cross platform, this includes Windows (WSL **and** non-WSL),
Raspberry Pi, all varieties of Linux. Building binaries for everything we
support.

tea allows you to “get started” anywhere (*just not quite yet*).

&nbsp;


# Magic

tea uses the concept of magic. In an environment with magic we try to be
clever and infer what you want. Without magic we are strict and
require precise specification of your intent.

You can disable magic by specifying `--muggle` or exporting `MAGIC=0` to your
shell environment.

We do magic per dependency by processing a `magic.ts` in the [pantry]. For
example with `deno` we extract your `import-map` specification from any
`.vscode/settings.json` we find in your virtual environment. Then if you
type `deno` on the command line we automatically inject the import map. You
can supplement our magic by contributing to the [pantry].

# Contributing

If you have suggestions or ideas, start a [discussion]. If we agree we’ll
move it to an issue. Bug fixes straight to pull request or issue please!

## Using A Local Checkout

When developing tea you often want to use that version as your primary tea
install. We provide a script to achieve this:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/teaxyz/cli tea
cd tea
./scripts/self-install.ts
```

The script replaces `/usr/local/bin/tea` with a `deno` instantiation that runs
your checkout, (installing deno first ofc).

# FAQ

## What are you doing to my computer?

We install compartmentalized packages to `/opt`,we create one symlink
(`/usr/local/bin/tea`) and we add one line to your `.zshrc`.

## I thought you were decentralized and web3 and shit

tea is creating new technologies that will change how open source is funded.
This software is an essential part of that endeavor and is released
prior to our protocol in order to bootstrap the open source revolution.

We don’t subscribe to any particular “web” at tea.xyz, our blockchain
component will be an implementation detail that you won’t need to think about
(but we think you will want to).

## I have another question

Start a [discussion] and we’ll get back to you.

## Troubleshooting

### `env: tea: No such file or directory`

If you got this error message, you need to install tea:
`sh <(curl https://tea.xyz)`.
