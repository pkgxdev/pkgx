Package managers are the foundation of every stack yet they haven’t evolved
in decades—*they still work the same way they always have*.

* Why are they so slow? So clunky? *So incapable*?
* Why do you need to use a different one (with subtly different syntax) on
    every platform?
* Why is it that you can have any version (*as long as its the latest*) but you
    have to wait weeks for it?

Introducing `tea`, the next-generation, cross-platform package manager from
the creator of [`brew`].

&nbsp;


# tea/cli 0.25.0

```sh
$ node --eval 'console.log("Hello World!")'
command not found: node

$ sh <(curl tea.xyz) --yes
installing ~/.tea…

$ node --eval 'console.log("Hello World!")'
tea: installing ~/.tea/nodejs.org/v19.5.0
Hello World!
```

With tea there is no *install packages step*. Just type the commands you need
and tea takes care of the rest: fetching packages, constructing a virtual
environment isolated from the rest of your system and then running your
commands.

Change your thinking from “I want to *install* foo” to “I want to *use* foo”.

> Check out [# Magic](#magic) to learn how this works.

Scripting’s been stuck in a dark age of Bash because it’s the only thing you
can be sure is installed. Lame af right?

```sh
$ tea ./hello.go
installing go…
go: running hello.go
#…

$ tea https://examples.deno.land/color-logging.ts
tea: installing deno…
#…

# need more dependencies than the interpreter? tea reads YAML front matter
$ tea ./favicon-generator input.png
tea: installing image-magick, optipng, guetzli and 3 other packages…
# …
output: favicon-128.png…

$ cat favicon-generator
#!/usr/bin/env ruby
# ^^ tea reads the shebang and automatically installs ruby
#---
# dependencies:
#   imagemagick.org: 4
#   optipng.sourceforge.net: 1
#---
```

You’re a developer, you need specific versions of tools, not just whatever
the package manager happens to have today.

```sh
$ node^16 --version
tea: installing node^16
v16.19.0

$ node~16.18 --version
tea: installing node~16.18
v16.18.1

# for even more control see the [semver cheatsheet](https://devhints.io/semver)
# though you will need to invoke tea directly
$ tea +nodejs.org'>=15 <17' node --version
v16.19.0
```

In fact you can construct *virtual environments* of specific tools and
versions encapsulated separately from the rest of your system.

```sh
$ tea +rust-lang.org^1.63 +python.org~3.11 sh
tea: this is a temporary shell containing rust-lang.org, python.org and 13 other packages
tea: type `exit` when done

tea $ rustc --version
rustc 1.65.0

tea $ python --version
Python 3.11.1

tea $ which rustc
~/.tea/rust-lang.org/v1.65.0/bin/rustc
# ^^ inside environments tools *are* in `PATH`

tea $ exit

$ which rustc
rustc not found
# remember: tea doesn’t install packages
```

And since typically different projects will need different versions, we
support that too:

```sh
$ node --version
v19.3.0

$ jq '.tea += {
  "dependencies": {"nodejs.org": "^18.4"}
}' package.json | sponge package.json
# ^^ specify the version of the tool you need in *that tool’s config*.
# we strongly prefer YAML front matter in a comment
# but here we add an isolated `tea` namespace since JSON can’t have comments
# NOTE tea will automatically fetch both jq and sponge when you run the above

$ cat <<EOF >>my-project/README.md
# Dependencies
| Project    | Version |
| ---------- | ------- |
| nodejs.org | ^18.4   |
EOF
# ^^ optionally, tea can also parse your README

$ cd my-project
$ node --version
v18.13.0

$ cd ..
$ node --version
v19.3.0
```

Using existing files further cements the notion that using tea is
*completely optional* for both you *and your users*.

They either use tea or they source the dependencies themselves.

Some files are indicators of what tools they need, so if you choose not to
explain them in a README that means you expect your users "just know" `package.json`
means `node`, `cargo.toml` means `rust` and so on.

Which is why you may prefer to encode the data in the `README` since then
it’s readable by *both humans **and** tea*.

&nbsp;


# Getting Started

tea is a standalone, cross-platform† binary. So if you wanted you could just
cURL it:

```sh
$ curl -Lo tea https://tea.xyz/$(uname)/$(uname -m)
$ chmod u+x ./tea

$ echo '# tea *really is* a standalone binary' | ./tea --sync glow -
tea: installing charm.sh/glow
# `tea --sync` updates pkgs, but you have to call it *at least once*
# our installer does this for you normally
```

However, if you want tea’s shell [magic](#magic), you’ll need our installer:

```sh
sh <(curl https://tea.xyz)
# • asks you to confirm before it sets up `~/.tea`
# • asks you to confirm before adding one line to your `~/.shellrc`
# • DOESN’T need `sudo` or the Xcode Command Line Tools
```

> † we support macOS >= 11 and Linux (glibc >= 23) and WSL, Windows native is
> being built *as we speak*.

<details><summary><code>`preview.gif`</code></summary>

![charm.sh/vhs recording](https://teaxyz.github.io/setup/sample.gif)

</details>

In fact, our one-liner *abstracts away installing tea itself*:

```sh
# will your node project work with bun.sh? find out without having to install it!
$ sh <(curl tea.xyz) bun run start

# if tea is installed, our one-liner uses the tea installation, if it’s not
# installed then it **doesn’t install tea** or any dependencies, it creates a
# sandbox and runs everything in there
```

> So now, in your blog posts, tweets, and tutorials, you don’t have to start
> with any “how to install tea” preamble nor will readers need to google anything.
> If they want to learn about tea first, they can go to the same URL as they’re
> curl’ing. We already work on Linux, macOS, and WSL; soon we’ll support Windows
> natively.

As a bonus the installer also updates tea.

## “Now see here fella’, I \*hate\* installers…”

Package managers can’t install themselves (`#cantfix`).
But there’s other ways:

```sh
$ brew install teaxyz/pkgs/tea-cli

# or just try it out first
$ docker run --rm -it teaxyz/cli
```

>
> * Or get a plain text listing of standalone binary download URLs:

>   ```sh
>   $ curl dist.tea.xyz   # then copy, paste and cURL again

## GitHub Actions

```yaml
- uses: teaxyz/setup@v0
# ^^ https://github.com/teaxyz/setup
```

[Our action] installs your deps and makes them (and tea) accessible to the rest
of the workflow.

[Our action]: https://github.com/teaxyz/setup

&nbsp;


# Developer Environments

Every project you work on needs different tools with different versions.
Installing those tools globally *makes no sense* and could even cause subtle
bugs during dev.

tea can determine the tools a project directory needs based on the files it
finds. With our shell magic just step into the project directory
and type commands; tea automatically fetches the specific versions those
projects need and runs them.

We try to be as clever as possible, eg. we parse the node version out of
a GitHub Action’s `action.yml`. If we see a `.node-version` file, we add that
version of node to the environment. We want to support everything that makes
sense (your PRs are *very* welcome!)

Where there isn’t a convention for specifying tool versions, you can add
YAML front matter to its configuration file. For example, if we’re
talking a python poetry project, then you can specify your python version by
adding YAML front matter to its `pyproject.toml`:

```sh
$ cat <<EoYAML >> pyproject.toml
# ---
# dependencies:
#   python.org: ^3.11.3
# ---
EoYAML
```

If your poetry project needs other non pypa dependencies (like a c compiler)
then you can add them there too (eg. `llvm.org`, our deps are always named
after project homepages because then you just google it and there’s no
ambiguity).

If you prefer we also support extracting your deps from a markdown table
under a `# Dependencies` section in your `README.md`:

```sh
$ cat <<EOF >>my-project/README.md
# Dependencies
| Project    | Version |
| ---------- | ------- |
| go.dev     | ^1      |
EOF
```

Using your `README` is *kinda* neat; it makes this data both machine and human
readable.

## Caveats

We still need to do a bit of work here. We don’t install any packages when
you step into a directory as that would violate the principle of least
surprise. But this may mean the full environment doesn’t work initially.
You can fix this with a `tea -SE && cd .`. We’re working on improving this.

## I added YAML front matter and it doesn’t work; what now?

* After changing any files you need to do a `cd .` to reload the environment.
* While debugging you can do `tea -E` to see if we’re picking up your changes.
* If it still doesn’t work open a [ticket]. This is either a bug or we don’t
    support your toolset yet.

## Supplementing the Environment

There are all sorts of variables a developer needs when working on a project
and tea aims to make them available to you. Thus we provide `SRCROOT` and
`VERSION`‡ in addition to everything else required to make your devenv
function. To see the full environment for your project run `tea -En` or simply
`env`.

> ‡ extracted from the `README.md` or `VERSION` files.

# Magic

Our magic puts the entire open source ecosystem at your fingertips.
Our installer enables it by adding some hooks to your shell:

* A hook when changing directory that sets up project environments
  * Environments are just shell environment variables
* A hook for the “command not found” scenario that installs that command
    before running it †

**Magic is entirely optional, tea is still entirely usable without it.** \
**Generally we’d say our magic is *for devs* and *not* for ops.**

> † Our “command not found” magic only works at a terminal prompt. Thus eg.
> VSCode won’t magically find `deno`. Shell scripts won’t automatically
> install tools they try to run. This is intentional. *Magic should not lead
> to anarchy*. See our [FAQ](#faq) for more information.

```sh
$ which bun
bun not found

$ tea --dry-run bun --version
imagined: bun.sh^0.4
~/.tea/bun.sh/v0.4.0/bin/bun --version

$ bun --version
tea: installing bun.sh^0.4
0.4.0

$ which bun
bun not found
# `bun` is not in your `PATH`
# ∵ tea doesn’t install packages
# ∴ using tea doesn’t compromise your system’s integrity

$ tea bun --version
0.4.0
# ^^ the same as `bun --version` but without magic
```

## Using `tea` Without Magic

Simply prefix everything with `tea`, eg. `tea npm start`.

## Using Developer Environments Without Magic

Simply prefix commands with `tea -E`, eg. `tea -E npm start`.

## Uninstalling `tea`’s Shell Magic

Our installer asked if you wanted magic when you ran it. If you elected to
install magic and no longer want it simply remove the one-liner from your
shell’s configuration file.

## Using Magic in Shell Scripts

Our magic is not automatically added to scripts, but you can manually add it:

```sh
source <(tea --magic=bash)
                   # ^^ you have to specify which shell tho
```

And of course you can also use our one-liner:

```sh
source <(curl tea.xyz | sh -s -- --magic=bash)
```

Thus you can make a script that can effortlessly use any tool from the open
source ecosystem. If they have tea installed it uses their installation, if
not it installs everything (including tea itself) to a temporary sandbox
that’s gone when the script completes.

### Injecting Packages without Using Magic

Our `+pkg` syntax *injects* packages into an environment, the commands are
then run in that environment.

```sh
# a script that needs `convert`
$ tea +imagemagick.org my-script.sh

# a VHS script that needs `wget`
$ tea +gnu.org/wget vhs demo.tape

# if tea doesn’t provide the package, it passes the args through to your system
$ tea +neovim.io which nvim
~/.tea/neovim.io/v0.8.2/bin/nvim

# in fact, `tea` is like an “env++”: just like `env` our purpose is to
# construct environments. Our `++` is: we also fetch packages. Thus, if you
# don’t specify what we should do with the environment, we dump it:
$ tea +zlib.net
MANPATH=/Users/mxl/.tea/zlib.net/v1.2.13/share/man:/usr/share/man
PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/Users/mxl/.tea/zlib.net/v1.2.13/lib/pkgconfig
LIBRARY_PATH=/Users/mxl/.tea/zlib.net/v1.2.13/lib
CPATH=/Users/mxl/.tea/zlib.net/v1.2.13/include
XDG_DATA_DIRS=/Users/mxl/.tea/zlib.net/v1.2.13/share
```

# Packagers Who Care

You trust us to just work and make your workflows happen.
We take this job seriously and we go the extra mile on a per-package basis,
eg. our git ignores `.DS_Store` files by default, and our RubyGems defaults to
user-installs and ensures gems are in `PATH`. Also we insist our packages
are relocatable, which is why we can install in your home directory (but this
also means you could pick up the whole `~/.tea` directory and bundle it with
your app.) We also begin packaging new releases almost immediately as soon as
they go live using various automations.


# Contributing

If you have suggestions or ideas, start a [discussion]. If we agree, we’ll
move it to an issue. Bug fixes straight to pull request or issue please!

Probably the place you’ll want to start is by supplementing the
[pantry][pantry.extra].

## Hacking on `tea`

`tea` is written in [TypeScript] using [deno].

```sh
git clone https://github.com/teaxyz/cli tea
cd tea

deno task run foo   # runs the local checkout passing `foo` as an argument
deno task install   # deploys the local checkout into your `~/.tea`
```

## Contributing Packages

There are hundreds-of-thousands of open source projects, and we need your help
supporting them! Check out the docs for the [pantry] to learn more.

# Appendix

## FAQ

### How do I update?

```sh
$ tea --sync
# ^^ updates the pantries, and any packages in the virtual-environment

$ tea --sync +deno.land
# ^^ updates specific packages

$ sh <(curl tea.xyz) --sync
# ^^ updates `tea` as well
```

### How do I view what is stowed?

```sh
open $(tea --prefix)
```

We hope to improve this UX very soon.

### I need a tool in `PATH` (aka `brew install`)

Symlinks† to `tea` automatically invoke their namesake:

```sh
$ ln -s $(which tea) /usr/local/bin/bun
$ bun --version
tea: installing bun…
bun 0.4.0

# you can version tools this way too
$ ln -s $(which tea) /usr/local/bin/bun~0.3
$ bun~0.3 --version
tea: installing bun=0.3.0
bun 0.3.0

# if you prefer you can symlink with a `tea+` or `tea_` prefix
$ ln -s $(which tea) /usr/local/bin/tea+node
$ tea+node --version
v19.3.0
```

> † this doesn’t work on Linux, you’ll need to use hard-links.
> this is a platform limitation we cannot work around 😞

### How do I use tea with editors like VSCode?

We intend to make a VSCode extension that automatically fetches the
environment for the active workspace. In the meantime, add tools to your `PATH`
as described in the above FAQ.

### What are these `^`, `~`, etc. symbols?

tea adheres to [semantic versioning](https://semver.org), and uses
[`semver`](https://github.com/npm/node-semver#versions) for parsing versions.

### How do I find available packages?

We list all packages at [tea.xyz](https://tea.xyz/+/).
Or `open ~/.tea/tea.xyz/var/pantry`.
We hope to improve this UX very soon, too.

### Will you support platform `foo`?

We want to support *all* platforms.
Start a [discussion] and let’s talk about how to move forward with that.

### What happened to executable markdown?

We may revisit it, but we realized quickly that because tea makes it
so trivial to use anything from the open source ecosystem, it also makes it trivial
for you as a developer to use [`xc`]†, `make` or [`just`] or any of the
myriad of other tools that are tightly scoped to the initial goals of
executable markdown.

> † xc actually *is* a more mature implementation of executable markdown and
> we think you should definitely check it out.

[`xc`]: https://github.com/joerdav/xc
[`just`]: https://just.systems

### How do I uninstall tea?

Delete everything under `~/.tea`. Job done.

> Strictly speaking, there's also an (automatically silenced) one-liner in your
> shell’s configuration file (eg. `~/.zshrc`) you may want to remove.

### I have another question

We have further FAQs in our [wiki](https://github.com/teaxyz/cli/wiki/FAQ).
Failing that, Start a [discussion] and we’ll get back to you.

## Troubleshooting

### `env: tea: No such file or directory`

If you got this error message, you need to install tea:
`sh <(curl -Ssf https://tea.xyz)`.

### Changing directory takes a long time sometimes

This is a known and insidious bug. Please open a [ticket] and report it to us.
tea’s magic should never significantly slow down directory changes.
