  ```

  Or in any image:

  ```Dockerfile
  FROM ubuntu

  </details>
* <details><summary>CI/CD</summary><br>

  ```yaml
  - uses: pkgxdev/setup@v2
  - run: pkgx shellcheck
  ```

  Or in other CI/CD providers:

  ```sh
  curl https://pkgx.sh | sh
  pkgx shellcheck
  ```

  > [docs.pkgx.sh/ci-cd]

  </details>
* <details><summary>Scripts</summary><br>

  ```sh
  #!/usr/bin/env -S pkgx +git python@3.12

  # python 3.12 runs the script and `git` is available during its execution
  ```

  </details>
* <details><summary>Editors</summary><br>

  ```sh
  $ cd myproj

  myproj $ env +cargo
  (+cargo) myproj $ code .
  ```

  Or use [`dev`][dev]; a separate tool that uses the pkgx primitives to
  automatically determine and utilize your dependencies based on your
  project‚Äôs keyfiles.

  ```sh
  $ cd myproj

  myproj $ dev
  env +cargo +rust

  (+cargo+rust) my-rust-project $ code .
  ```

# The `pkgx` Ecosystem

`pkgx` is not just a package runner, it‚Äôs a composable primitive that can be
used to build a whole ecosystem of tools.

## `dev`

`dev` uses `pkgx` and shellcode to create ‚Äúvirtual environments‚Äù consisting
of the specific versions of tools and their dependencies you need for your
projects.

```sh
$ cd my-rust-proj && ls
Cargo.toml  src/

my-rust-proj $ cargo build
command not found: cargo

my-rust-proj $ dev
+rust +cargo

my-rust-proj $ cargo build
Compiling my-rust-proj v0.1.0
#‚Ä¶
```

> [github.com/pkgxdev/dev][dev]


## `pkgm`

`pkgm` installs `pkgx` packages to `/usr/local`. It installs alongside `pkgx`.

> [github.com/pkgxdev/pkgm][pkgm]


## Scripting

A powerful use of `pkgx` is scripting, eg. here‚Äôs a script to release new
versions to GitHub:

```sh
#!/usr/bin/env -S pkgx +gum +gh +npx +git bash>=4 -eo pipefail

gum format "# determining new version"

versions="$(git tag | grep '^v[0-9]\+\.[0-9]\+\.[0-9]\+')"
v_latest="$(npx -- semver --include-prerelease $versions | tail -n1)"
v_new=$(npx -- semver bump $v_latest --increment $1)

gum format "# releasing v$v_new"

gh release create \
  $v_new \
  --title "$v_new Released üéâ" \
  --generate-notes \
  --notes-start-tag=v$v_latest
```

Above you can see how we ‚Äúloaded‚Äù the shebang with `+pkg` syntax to bring in
all the tools we needed.

> We have pretty advanced versions of the above script, eg
> [teaBASE][teaBASE-release-script]

There‚Äôs tools for just about every language ecosystem so you can import
dependencies. For example, here we use `uv` to run a python script with
pypi dependencies, and pkgx to load both `uv` and a specific python version:

```sh
#!/usr/bin/env -S pkgx +python@3.11 uv run --script

# /// script
# dependencies = [
#   "requests<3",
#   "rich",
# ]
# ///

import requests
from rich.pretty import pprint

resp = requests.get("https://peps.python.org/api/peps.json")
data = resp.json()
pprint([(k, v["title"]) for k, v in data.items()][:10])
```

> [!TIP]
>
> ### Mash
>
> We love scripting with `pkgx` so much that we made a whole package manager
> for scripts to show the world what is possible when the whole open source
> ecosystem is available to your scripts Check it out [`mash`].

> [!INFO]
>
> Notably, packages used during your script aren‚Äôt installed and don‚Äôt pollute
> your system and anyone else‚Äôs systems either. Don‚Äôt be confused‚Äî they are
> downloaded to `~/.pkgx` but the wider system is not touched.

## Recursive Run

Easily run tools from other language ecosystems:

```sh
pkgx uvx cowsay "Run Python (PyPi) programs with `uvx`"  # or pipx
pkgx bunx cowsay "Run JavaScript (NPM) programs tools with `bunx`"  # or `npx`
```

## Magic

It can be fun to add magic to your shell:

```sh
# add to ~/.zshrc
command_not_found_handler() {
  pkgx -- "$@"
}
```

Thus if you type `gh` and it‚Äôs not installed pkgx will magically run it as
though it was installed all along.

> [!NOTE]
> Bash is the same function but drop the `r` from the end of the name.

# Further Reading

[docs.pkgx.sh][docs] is a comprehensive manual and user guide for the `pkgx`
suite.

# Migrating from `pkgx`^1

## Shellcode

The `pkgx` suite has had its scopes tightened. There is no shellcode in `pkgx`
anymore. Instead [`dev`] is its own separate tool that has its own shellcode.
Migrate your shell configuration with:

```sh
pkgx pkgx^1 deintegrate
pkgx dev integrate
```

## `env +foo`

If you used this, let us know, we can make a mash script to provide this
functionality again. You can achieve the same result as eg. `env +git` with:

```sh
eval "$(pkgx +git)"
```

Surround the `eval` with `set -a` and `set +a` if you need the environment
exported.

## `pkgx install`

We now provide [`pkgm`][pkgm] but if you miss the leanness of ‚Äústubs‚Äù we
provide a [`mash`] script to create stubs in `/usr/local/bin`:

```sh
$ pkgx mash pkgx/stub git
created stub: /usr/local/bin/git

$ cat /usr/local/bin/git
#!/bin/sh
exec pkgx git "$@"
```

# Contributing

We recommend using [`dev`] to make rust available.

* To add packages see the [pantry README]
* To hack on `pkgx` itself; clone it and `cargo build`
  * [`hydrate.rs`] is where optimization efforts will bear most fruit

## Pre-PR Linting

```sh
cargo fmt --all --check
cargo clippy --all-features
pkgx npx markdownlint --config .github/markdownlint.yml --fix .
```
