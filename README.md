### Quickstart

```sh
brew install pkgx || curl https://pkgx.sh | sh
```

```pwsh
# Windows 10+
irm https://pkgx.sh | iex
# ^^ we only have limited packages so far
```

> [docs.pkgx.sh/installing-w/out-brew]

&nbsp;

# Run Anything

```sh
$ deno
command not found: deno

$ pkgx deno
Deno 2.1.4
> ^D

$ deno
command not found: deno
# ^^ nothing was installed; your wider system is untouched
```

## Run _Any Version_ of Anything

```sh
$ pkgx node@14 --version
Node.js v14.21.3

$ pkgx python@2 --version
Python 2.7.18
```

We provide an image with `pkgx` in it:

```sh
$ pkgx docker run -it pkgxdev/pkgx

(docker) $ pkgx node@16
Welcome to Node.js v16.20.1.
Type ".help" for more information.
>
```

You can use this image to try out (pretty much) any version of any program:

```sh
$ docker run pkgxdev/pkgx node@21.1 --version
v21.1.0
```

Or in a `Dockerfile`:

```Dockerfile
FROM pkgxdev/pkgx
RUN pkgx deno@1.35 task start
```

Or in any image:

```Dockerfile
FROM ubuntu
RUN curl https://pkgx.sh | sh
RUN pkgx python@3.10 -m http.server 8000
```

pkgx shellcheck
```

Use [`dev`][dev]; a separate tool that uses the pkgx primitives to
automatically determine and utilize your dependencies based on your project‚Äôs
keyfiles.

```sh
$ cd myproj

myproj $ dev
+cargo +rust

myproj $ code .
```

</details>

## What Can `pkgx` Run?

We have a web based package listing at
[pkgx.dev/pkgs](https://pkgx.dev/pkgs/).

From the CLI you can use query mode:

```sh
$ pkgx -Q git
# ^^ can you run git? (outputs the fully qualified project name)

$ pkgx -Q
# ^^ list everything that could be run

$ pkgx -Q | grep git-
# ^^ what git extensions does pkgx provide?
```

&nbsp;

# The `pkgx` Ecosystem

`pkgx` is not just a package runner, it‚Äôs a composable primitive that can be
used to build a whole ecosystem of tools.

## `dev`

`dev` uses `pkgx` and shellcode to create ‚Äúvirtual environments‚Äù consisting of
the specific versions of tools and their dependencies you need for your
projects.

```sh
$ cd my-rust-proj && ls
Cargo.toml  src/

my-rust-proj $ cargo build
command not found: cargo

my-rust-proj $ dev
+rust +cargo

my-rust-proj $ cargo build
Compiling my-rust-proj v0.1.0
#‚Ä¶
```

> [github.com/pkgxdev/dev][dev]

## `pkgm`

`pkgm` installs `pkgx` packages to `/usr/local`. It installs alongside `pkgx`.

> [github.com/pkgxdev/pkgm][pkgm]

## Scripting

A powerful use of `pkgx` is scripting, eg. here‚Äôs a script to release new
versions to GitHub:

```sh
#!/usr/bin/env -S pkgx +gum +gh +npx +git bash>=4 -eo pipefail

gum format "# determining new version"

versions="$(git tag | grep '^v[0-9]\+\.[0-9]\+\.[0-9]\+')"
v_latest="$(npx -- semver --include-prerelease $versions | tail -n1)"
v_new=$(npx -- semver bump $v_latest --increment $1)

gum format "# releasing v$v_new"

gh release create \
  $v_new \
  --title "$v_new Released üéâ" \
  --generate-notes \
  --notes-start-tag=v$v_latest
```

Above you can see how we ‚Äúloaded‚Äù the shebang with `+pkg` syntax to bring in all
the tools we needed.

> We have pretty advanced versions of the above script, eg
> [teaBASE][teaBASE-release-script]

There‚Äôs tools for just about every language ecosystem so you can import
dependencies. For example, here we use `uv` to run a python script with pypi
dependencies, and pkgx to load both `uv` and a specific python version:

```sh
#!/usr/bin/env -S pkgx +python@3.11 uv run

# /// script
# dependencies = [
#   "requests<3",
#   "rich",
# ]
# ///

import requests
from rich.pretty import pprint

resp = requests.get("https://peps.python.org/api/peps.json")
data = resp.json()
pprint([(k, v["title"]) for k, v in data.items()][:10])
```

> [!TIP]
>
> ### Mash
>
> We love scripting with `pkgx` so much that we made a whole package manager for
> scripts to show the world what is possible when the whole open source
> ecosystem is available to your scripts Check it out [`mash`].

> [!NOTE]
>
> Notably, packages used during your script aren‚Äôt installed and don‚Äôt pollute
> your system and anyone else‚Äôs systems either. Don‚Äôt be confused‚Äî they are
> downloaded to `~/.pkgx` but the wider system is not touched.

## `pkgo` (Package‚Ä¶GO!)

Some Open Source resists packaging and instead includes long installation
instructions that can be‚Ä¶ tedious. [`pkgo`] makes using amazing tools like
[‚ÄúStable Diffusion WebUI‚Äù] as easy as typing `pkgo` (thanks to `pkgx`).

## Recursive Run

Easily run tools from other language ecosystems:

```sh
pkgx uvx cowsay "Run Python (PyPi) programs with `uvx`"  # or pipx
pkgx bunx cowsay "Run JavaScript (NPM) programs tools with `bunx`"  # or `npx`
```

# Further Reading

[docs.pkgx.sh][docs] is a comprehensive manual and user guide for the `pkgx`
suite.

# Migrating from `pkgx`^1

## Shellcode

The `pkgx` suite has had its scopes tightened. There is no shellcode in `pkgx`
anymore. Instead [`dev`] is its own separate tool that has its own shellcode.
Migrate your shell configuration with:

```sh
pkgx pkgx^1 deintegrate
pkgx dev integrate
```

## `env +foo`

If you used this, let us know, we can make a mash script to provide this
functionality again. You can achieve the same result as eg. `env +git` with:

```sh
eval "$(pkgx +git)"
```

Surround the `eval` with `set -a` and `set +a` if you need the environment
exported.

## `pkgx install`

We now provide [`pkgm`][pkgm] which fully installs `pkgx` packages to
`/usr/local/`.

If you miss the leanness of pkgx^1 ‚Äúshims then use `pkgm shim`.

```sh
$ pkgm shim git
created shim: ~/.local/bin/git

$ cat ~/.local/bin/git
#!/usr/bin/env -S pkgx -q! git
```

# Contributing

We recommend using [`dev`] to make rust available.

- To add packages see the [pantry README]
- To hack on `pkgx` itself; clone it and `cargo build`
  - [`hydrate.rs`] is where optimization efforts will bear most fruit

## Pre-PR Linting

```sh
cargo fmt --all --check
cargo clippy --all-features
pkgx npx markdownlint --config .github/markdownlint.yml --fix .
```
